    <h1>Loops</h1>
    <p>
      Loops are very important in Javascript. They are used to do a task over
      and over again.
    </p>
    <p>There are 4 types of Loops: While, do/while, for, & for/in</p>
    <h2>While loop</h2>
    <p>
      While loops are helpful for when you don't know how many times repetition
      is required and need to customize the incremenet/decrement behavior
    </p>
    <h3>While results</h3>
    <div id="while"></div>

    <h2>For loop</h2>
    <p>
      The for loop is great for repeating something a set amount of times.
      Increment/decrement are automatic.
    </p>

    <h3>For results</h3>
    <div id="for"></div>

    <script src="loops.js"></script>
