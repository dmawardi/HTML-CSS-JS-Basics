    <h1>Conditionals</h1>
    <p>
      Conditionals in Javascript allow you to determine which blocks of code get
      executed based on a condition
    </p>
    <h2>If/Else</h2>
    <p>
      The most important conditional statements are if/else statements. This
      allows you to place a decision making junction in your code, where it will
      activate one portion of code if true, or the other block if not
    </p>

    <p>
      To use an if/else statement, you must prepare a condition of which to base
      it off. This condition must resolve to a boolean (True/False)
    </p>
    Result of If else statement in JS: <span id="ifElseResult"></span>

    <h2>Switch Statements</h2>
    <p>
      A switch statement is best used when you have a lot of different choices
      to make. Usually, anything greater than 3 decisions are best to place in a
      switch statement rather than an if/else
    </p>

    Result of switch statement in JS: <span id="switchResult"></span>

    Conditional operators:
    <br />
    <table>
      <thead>
        <th>Operator</th>
        <th>Desc.</th>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>== / ===</td>
          <td>Checks if equal to</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>!==</td>
          <td>Checks if not equal to</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>>=</td>
          <td>Checks if greater than or equal to</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><=</td>
          <td>Checks if less than or equal to</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>></td>
          <td>Checks if greater than</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><</td>
          <td>Checks if less than</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
