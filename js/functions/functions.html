    <h1>Functions</h1>
    <p>
      Functions are blocks of code that are in stasis and can be called at any
      time. This is great for reusability and leads to cleaner code
    </p>
    <p>
      Functions are also capable of being used within other functions. This
      makes repeatability easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A function can be declared in a number of different ways in JS depending
      on the version. They all work, and you may have a favorite; but it's
      important to know each way that a function is declared to be able to
      recognize it when seeing other people's code.
